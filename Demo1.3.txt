Here created version 1.3 ....

i have done branching 
created branch by following command 
git branch firstbranch

working into the branch by following command
git checkout firstbranch 

coming out from the branch 
git checkout main

learning merging
it is a way of combine the work of different branches together.

Allows to branch off , develop a new feature & combine it back in.

git stash 
git stash temporarily shelves changes you have made to your working copy so you can workon something else and then comeback and reapply them later on.

back to merging
my demo1.4 is in my new branch firstbranch and it is not in main branch... if i have to add it to main branch i will use command git merge command and give name of the file
we want to merge our new branch work into main or master branch , so master is our destination , so always checkout in destination branch in this case main.
git merge firstbranch
if we wants to changes in demo1.4 which is in first branch ..it would affect main brancg demo1.4

cat FILENAME is used to see changes done in the file.
eg  cat Demo1.3.txt will show all the data that appened jus now after commit.

Rebasing
